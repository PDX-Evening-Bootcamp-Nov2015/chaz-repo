<!-- The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and
usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a
paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line and used to
group larger chunks of code. -->

<!-- The uses for divs and spans will become more clear when we start covering CSS.
They are used to group together a chunk of HTML and attach some information to
the chunk using IDs or Classes.  It is used extensively with Bootstrap which we
will cover later. -->
